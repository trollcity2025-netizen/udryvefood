Project Name: UdryveAuto
Instruction Type: Full system generation + clone-based refactor

PROMPT START

Clone the existing project UdryveFood into a new, completely separate project named UdryveAuto.
Do NOT modify UdryveFood.
UdryveAuto must reuse the same architecture, database patterns, authentication system, role-based access control, admin tooling, and UI structure as UdryveFood, but adapt all business logic and UI for an auto parts marketplace.

1) Core Concept

UdryveAuto is an auto parts marketplace similar to Uber Eats, where:

Stores (partners) replace restaurants

Shipping is primary, local delivery optional

Customers must verify part fitment before ordering

Stores must approve fitment before checkout is allowed

Refunds are disabled unless store verification is proven wrong

2) User Roles (must match UdryveFood patterns)

Reuse UdryveFood RBAC and permissions exactly, with renamed roles:

Admin

Full system access

View and impersonate all roles and pages

Approve / disable stores, customers, couriers

View all messages, orders, disputes

Store (Partner)

Apply to register (approval required)

Full access to inventory management

Messaging with customers

Fitment verification responsibility

Fulfillment, payouts, returns policy control

Customer

Browse parts

Save vehicles

Message stores

Must complete 3-step verification before ordering

Courier (optional / feature-flagged)

Only for local delivery

Job acceptance, tracking, payouts

3) Store Partner Registration & Approval

Create a public “Become a Partner” flow:

Multi-step application form

Business info, fulfillment type, returns policy

Upload documents (license, resale cert)

Choose catalog source (manual, CSV, WooCommerce API)

Admin dashboard:

Application queue (pending / approved / rejected)

Messaging with applicants

Approve → Store dashboard access unlocked

4) Inventory & Open-Source Integration

Stores must have full inventory control:

Manual product creation

CSV import/export

WooCommerce REST API connector (phase 1)

Product fields: SKU, MPN, specs, images, weight, dimensions

Inventory sync & pricing rules

5) Mandatory Store ↔ Customer Messaging

Implement a built-in messaging system, cloned from UdryveFood chat patterns but enhanced:

Product-level messaging (“Ask about fitment”)

Cart-level verification messaging

Order-level messaging (persistent)

Admin must be able to view all messages.

6) HARD GATED 3-STEP VERIFICATION SYSTEM (NO BYPASS)

Checkout must be blocked until ALL steps are completed.

STEP 1 — Vehicle Verification (Customer)

Save/select vehicle: Year, Make, Model, Trim, Engine

Optional VIN (strongly encouraged)

Customer must explicitly confirm vehicle accuracy

STEP 2 — Part Confirmation (Customer)

Confirm exact part number (SKU / MPN)

Confirm specs (side, size, compatibility notes)

Confirm quantity

Checkbox: “I confirm this is the part I need”

STEP 3 — Store Fitment Verification (REQUIRED)

Store must explicitly mark one:

✅ Verified Fit

⚠️ Conditional (request more info)

❌ Not Compatible

Store verification must be recorded immutably:

store_user_id

timestamp

vehicle snapshot JSON

part snapshot JSON

notes / evidence (VIN, photos)

Only after Verified Fit → checkout enabled

7) Order & Refund Enforcement

No refunds for customer error

Refunds allowed ONLY if:

Store verified fit incorrectly

Wrong/damaged item shipped

Non-delivery

Admin dispute review system

All decisions logged

8) Payments & Payouts

Clone UdryveFood payment flow:

PayPal checkout

PayPal payouts to stores

Admin commission system

Payout dashboard for stores

9) Admin Superpowers (Must Match UdryveFood)

Admin must be able to:

View system as Customer / Store / Courier

Disable any account instantly

View all inventory across all stores

View all verification logs

Override fitment decisions (logged)

10) UI / UX Requirements

Preserve UdryveFood UI structure and routing

Rename and restyle for auto parts

Clear verification badges:

Pending

Verified

Needs Info

Checkout disabled messaging explaining why

11) Technical Requirements

Same tech stack as UdryveFood

Same auth, middleware, DB patterns

New database namespace/tables where needed

Feature flags for courier delivery

Google Maps ONLY (for pickup/local delivery)

12) Project Rules (Critical)

UdryveFood must remain untouched

UdryveAuto must be a full clone with refactored logic

Shared code allowed only if abstracted safely

All verification and messaging must be auditable![alt text](image.png)
